# multiThread


This program takes in a list of URL input files followed by number of threads from the command line and produces ip addresses written to a file called parserout.txt, for example, `./multilookup names1.txt names2.txt 2`.

There is one restriction which is that the number of threads must be a multiple of the number of input files.  Once a thread has finished it will be written to a file called parserout.txt
